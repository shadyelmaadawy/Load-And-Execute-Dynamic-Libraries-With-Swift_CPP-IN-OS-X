# Load And Execute Dynamic Libraries With Swift/CPP In OSX

### *Here's to ones who push the human race forward!*

There's not much talking, technical details have been explained before, just a greetings to those out there, As I said in my [previous article](https://github.com/shadyelmaadawy/Load-Dex-Classes-In-Memory), I will Implement a loader with Swift.. a few lines of codes, but honestly, it cost me a lot of time!

#### Note:

The dynamic library is written with my tank, and the loader is written with my submarine.

## Proof-Of-Concept:

## **IOS/Custom Memory Loader**:

IOS is kinda different from macOS, and I am fighting furiously on my own against the compiler, 
Maybe I got some help from reverse engineering science and its tools to understand how the OS works under the hood, but APPLE doesn't provide much information, 

Also, I do not need both of them currently, and super-busy nowadays preparing some things, 
Just wanna continue my party with Xcode, so both will be delayed indefinitely, maybe later I will Implement a pure example in Swift.
